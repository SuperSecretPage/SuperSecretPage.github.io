  <h1>A (Hopefully) Helpful Guide</h1>

  <p>You may be asking, did I really make a webpage just for this? Yes, I absolutely
    did. I know you may not want to admit it, but this is what peak web development looks like ;)</p>

  <p>Jokes aside, it was a good excuse to learn a little coding this summer, in the
    spirit of keeping busy...</p>

  <p>So, onto what I know you are here for, a hint... By now you should have found
    a few images, so here is a handy guide to make good use of them. So multiple individuals may become one.
    I am naturally referring to the images, and the images alone.</p>

  <!--Centered Image Start-->

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="400" src="placeholder.jpeg" alt="placeholder">
  </div>
  <!--Centered Image End-->

  <p>I'd wish you good luck again, but I know you are too smart to need any.</p>

  <p>Onwards with your quest, I will see you at the finish line!</p>
