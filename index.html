  <h1>A (Hopefully) Helpful Guide</h1>

  <p>Another link, another website. I learned how to do it once, may as well use it again for dramatic effect.</p>

  <p>By now you should have found a few images, so here is a handy guide to make good use of them.
    So multiple individuals may become one. I am naturally referring to the images, and the images alone.</p>

  <p>If you have not found all the images yet, perhaps give those videos another watch, they may
    or may not contain more than it looks...</p>

  <!--Centered Image Start-->

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="750px" src="assembling-guide-image.png" alt="You are curious, aren't you? Well, you've definitely earned another hint... pictures can be moved, but they can also be rotated.">
  </div>
  <!--Centered Image End-->

  <p>I'd wish you good luck again, but I know you are too smart to need any.</p>

  <p>Onwards with your quest, I will see you at the finish line!</p>

  <p>Seems like this may be the last webpage for this quest, as keen on improving my craft,
    feel free to leave a review below ;)</p>
